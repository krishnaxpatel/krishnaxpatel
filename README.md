   - Data Collection, Management & Security
   - Data Cleaning
   - Data Processing
   - Data Analysis
   - Data Interpretation & Visualizations

  I also got to work with and learn important tools in the data analytics world!

   - Tableau
   - R Programming 
 
 Recently I have been working on data analytic projects, using what I learned throughout the course, but also gaining more experience throughout the process.
